## Important: Publication Dates

**CRITICAL:** Always use accurate publication dates in both:

1. **Schema.org structured data** (`datePublished` in JSON-LD)
2. **Visible article date** (in the article header)

### Why This Matters

- Search engines use `datePublished` to determine content freshness
- Incorrect dates can trigger duplicate content penalties
- Future dates may cause search engines to delay indexing
- Metadata disclosure risks if draft dates are exposed

### How to Set Dates

When creating a new article:

```html
<!-- Update Schema.org date -->
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "datePublished": "YYYY-MM-DD",  <!-- Use actual publication date -->
  "dateModified": "YYYY-MM-DD"    <!-- Update when article is modified -->
}
</script>

<!-- Update visible date -->
<span>📅 Month Day, Year</span>  <!-- Use human-readable format -->
```

**Best Practice:** Set both dates to the day you actually publish the article.

### Updating Existing Articles

When making significant updates:
- Update `dateModified` in Schema.org
- Optionally add "Updated: [Date]" to article header
- Keep original `datePublished` unchanged

## Writing Guidelines

When writing content for these articles:

1. **Write for humans first, SEO second**
   - Natural, conversational tone
   - Solve real problems
   - Include practical examples

2. **Structure for readability**
   - Use headings (H2, H3) to break up content
   - Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
   - Bullet points and numbered lists
   - Code examples where relevant

3. **Include keywords naturally**
   - Don't force keywords
   - Use variations and related terms
   - Focus on search intent

4. **Add value**
   - Answer common questions
   - Provide actionable tips
   - Include before/after examples
   - Link to Strim features when relevant

5. **Call to action**
   - Each article should guide readers to try Strim
   - Include CTA boxes throughout
   - Make it easy to start using the tool

## Next Steps

1. Decide content creation approach:
   - Write manually (high quality, time-consuming)
   - Use AI assistance (faster, needs editing)
   - Hire content writer (best for scale)

2. Prioritize articles by impact:
   - **High priority:** Articles 2, 5 (target high-search-volume keywords)
   - **Medium priority:** Articles 3, 4 (niche but valuable)

3. Set publishing schedule:
   - Aim for 1 article per week
   - Build momentum gradually
   - Promote each article on Reddit, Twitter, forums

## Expected SEO Impact

Once all 5 articles are published:

- **Month 1:** 100-300 organic visitors from long-tail keywords
- **Month 3:** 500-1,000 visitors as Google indexes and ranks
- **Month 6:** 1,500-3,000 visitors as articles gain authority

Articles compound over time - the sooner they're published, the better!
