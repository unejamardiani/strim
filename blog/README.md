## Next Steps

1. Decide content creation approach:
   - Write manually (high quality, time-consuming)
   - Use AI assistance (faster, needs editing)
   - Hire content writer (best for scale)

2. Prioritize articles by impact:
   - **High priority:** Articles 2, 5 (target high-search-volume keywords)
   - **Medium priority:** Articles 3, 4 (niche but valuable)

3. Set publishing schedule:
   - Aim for 1 article per week
   - Build momentum gradually
   - Promote each article on Reddit, Twitter, forums

## Expected SEO Impact

Once all 5 articles are published:

- **Month 1:** 100-300 organic visitors from long-tail keywords
- **Month 3:** 500-1,000 visitors as Google indexes and ranks
- **Month 6:** 1,500-3,000 visitors as articles gain authority

Articles compound over time - the sooner they're published, the better!
